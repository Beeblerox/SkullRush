# SkullRush
SkullRush is an open-source (GPLv3) 2D online multiplayer shooter. Think of it as Quake meets Mario.

This is my attempt at making the game I have been envisioning for a long time. While there exist
other games of the same type, I've found none to be particularly alike to the experience I wanted.
